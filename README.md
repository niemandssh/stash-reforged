# Stash: Reforged

This is changed version of Stash App!\
I changed original repository for my own personal requests so it could be better than original app (but it harder to run server and maybe a little bi unstable).

_**If you want you can suggest some improvements or functionality - you are welcome**_! (Maybe this functionality will appear faster here than original stash app).

This version will be always in develop branch.

**Some new features**:
* Scenes recommendations (by weights of tags, performers, studio and groups)
* Tag weights: some tags matter than other
* "Random" button, "Random best" button - shows random scene by rating
* Performer's photo cropper
* Broken video status for scene
* 10-stars rating by half star
* RIP ribbon for death performers 

### About Stash
[Original repository](https://github.com/stashapp/stash)

**Stash is a self-hosted webapp written in Go which organizes and serves your porn.**

![demo image](docs/readme_assets/demo_image.png)

* Stash gathers information about videos in your collection from the internet, and is extensible through the use of community-built plugins for a large number of content producers and sites.
* Stash supports a wide variety of both video and image formats.
* You can tag videos and find them later.
* Stash provides statistics about performers, tags, studios and more.

You can [watch a SFW demo video](https://vimeo.com/545323354) to see it in action.

For further information you can consult the [documentation](https://docs.stashapp.cc) or [read the in-app manual](ui/v2.5/src/docs/en).
